Pixelator
=========

A really simple tool to generate one element css box-shadow pixel style.

Live demo: http://elrumordelaluz.github.io/Pixelator/

After made Marty McPixel (http://codepen.io/elrumordelaluz/pen/sHjrF), 
it came to my mind the idea of a possible tool to generate this things without code.
I made something like this little tool I had in mind and here is (a working-progress)...

Up to now it's possible to set the grid and the output pixel size.

I have in mind lot of todos to apply.
I really want to know your comments to improve this tool.


Fast intro
==========
1. Set the grid (columns & rows) and the pixel size for the output element and create it!
2. Modify the colour presets or add (up to 13 presets). The default-color is red "#f00". // Left side
3. To select the 'actual-color' just click on the number of any preset or trigger the keyboard number, only works on 1 to 9 numbers for now :/
4. Click on every pixel you want and pain the selected-color
5. Preview the result element (with box-shadow) //Right side
6. Copy the code generated // Bottom side
7. Really appreciate if yout tweet me or comment to improve this first release...
